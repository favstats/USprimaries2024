### Methodology


In collaboration with [Who Targets Me](https://whotargets.me/), we monitored `r read_lines("../n_advertisers.txt")` political advertisers in `r the_country` during the `r election_title` to better understand how campaigns use different targeting methods made available by Meta. To do this, we used data from the [Meta Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/), using the new 'Audience' data which gives some detail on how pages target their ads. 

To better understand the election, we kept only advertisers who:

1. Advertised in the last 7 days (`r read_csv("../data/lastdays.csv")$last7days`)
2. Advertised in the last 30 days (`r read_csv("../data/lastdays.csv")$last30days`)


::: {.callout-note}
Meta only provides 7, 30 and 90 days windows for the targeting data in their Ad Library. Meta's data also lags by a few days. Report will be updated as soon as new data is available.

## Disclaimer

The data shown in this dashboard is based on the platform's respective ad libraries which are known to be sometimes incomplete ([Edelson et al. 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9152626?casa_token=X9SB7c8W9rAAAAAA:ymZr9ynFNTU6Fjzg3dcQpBzZpJ8bsEfj-H0RVTu2EZafKjhcD5Zu_VQ0aJc6qi9OMks3mUdFs-g); [Silva et al. 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380109?casa_token=ddoyvLl4R5YAAAAA:JqVLRLe6GHlR2o4zZqbEMlReyuTTyQxCGteUkdcFMR0xuCYWgwdl3NKyK05REOZm8vYl_W-bjOEaepM)). For this reason the data shown here might not reflect the full picture nor all political ads that were targeted at voters.
